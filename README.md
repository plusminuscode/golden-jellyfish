## Sea creatures
---
There are three types of sea inhabitants you will meet: **good**, **bad** and **magical**. Good characters are always willing to help and provide you with multiple hints where to find a golden jellyfish. Bad characters are sleezy and misleading. They may pretend to be good but they will lead you astray. Magical characters will tease you and be naughty. You never know what they are up to.

 Among the creatures that you are most likely to meet in the first three rounds are:

* Green jellyfish
* Pink jellyfish
* Sea stars
* Fluffy octopus
* Curious seahorse

## :ocean: What to look for
---
Try to look for arrows and golden bubbles. These are sure signs of the golden jellyfish mingling around.
Aside these hints you might find next items useful:
1. Broken shells. Jellyfish like to sleep under these.
2. Human stuff like coins, plastic cups and beach inventory. It indicates other people were hunting for jellyfish here.
3. Purple algae. Golden jellyfish eat only this type of algae.
